## Objectives
```
GIVEN a note-taking application
WHEN I open the Note Taker
THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
THEN a "Save Note" button and a "Clear Form" button appear in the navigation at the top of the page
WHEN I click on the Save button
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes and the buttons in the navigation disappear
WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column and a "New Note" button appears in the navigation
WHEN I click on the "New Note" button in the navigation at the top of the page
THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column and the button disappears
```

## Development

For this project, I built the back end server for the provided front end code. I had a moderate amount of trouble with my understanding of promises and where they are needed, making the task much more complicated than it needed to be, but eventually ended up with what feels like a simple solution contained in the servver.js form.

## Installation and Usage
To use this app, no installation is required - simply [launch the deployed app](https://tranquil-sierra-48962-0e1eb622b290.herokuapp.com/) and start adding and deleting notes!
